How to contribute
=================

##Fork this repo
Fork [this repo](https://github.com/SoftwareSandbox/FiAngulartje/) into your own account, e.g. `git@github.com:MyGithubAccount/FiAngulartje.git` and clone your forked repo locally:  
```
git clone https://github.com/MyGithubAccount/FiAngulartje
git remote add swsb https://github.com/SoftwareSandbox/FiAngulartje
```


##Setting up your environment
1. Install [nodejs](http://nodejs.org/), which you'll need for [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/). On Ubuntu? Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager)
2. After cloning your forked repo, run the following commands:
````
sudo npm install -g yo
sudo npm install -g generator-angular
sudo npm install -g bower
sudo npm install -g grunt-cli
sudo npm install
bower install
grunt serve
````
3. Your default browser should have popped up with a working initial screen of the application which uses a stubbed backend.
4. If you want to start the application with integration with the Fiazard backend, run the following command:
````
grunt serve:integrate
````


##Pick up backlog items
1. Pick up a backlog item at [waffle.io](https://waffle.io/softwaresandbox/fiangulartje) and assign it to yourself
2. Make sure you are in sync with the latest version of the repository:  
  `git pull swsb master`
3. create a local branch for the feature you will be implementing (eg feature-branch-{featureId}):  
  `git checkout -b feature-branch-{featureId}`
4. commit your changes to the local branch + push them to your forked repo:  
  `git commit -m 'connect #{featureId} {my specific comments}'`
5. push your changes to your forked repo (use -u to push the feature branch):  
  `git push -u feature-branch-{featureId}`
6. create a pull request in github
7. [Travis ci](https://travis-ci.org/SoftwareSandbox/FiAngulartje) will automatically pick up your changes and build
8. When the build is green, a contributor will accept/reject your changes + remove the feature-branch in order not to pollute the repo.
9. Remove your feature branch locally (not necessary - but will make your local repo cleaner):  
  `git branch -d feature-branch-{featureId}`
10. Remove your remote feature branch:  
  `git push --delete origin feature-branch-{featureId}`


##Suggestions
You might want to install the [AngularJS](https://github.com/angular-ui/AngularJS-sublime-package) package if you're using SublimeText.
